# Brief

- Inroductionn to project and Software Requirements
The app is intended to be public and be of a CRUD nature (Create, Delete, Update and Delete) and will utilize databases store and manage information. 

The purpose of the software to be created is to allow the user to access a web application hosted in the cloud (Azure). The web application to be created will have the following functionalities.
-	Will allow the user to create, delete , read and update information on each of the pages (Month and Anime).
-	Will feature a mySQL database, hosted in Azure mySQL Databases, and will have two tables, Month (Parent) and Anime(Child).
-	Will have an Angular frontend written in JavaScript , CSS and HTML. As a stretch goal, this will be implemented only if time allows. If not, a frontend in C# would be okay for the MVP.

-	Once built, the application will then be tested in the Testing Environment of Azure DevOps. Jasmin will be used if the frontend is in Angular. If not, testing will be done in 
-	The application will then be deployed on Azure App Service. 
-	The code will continuously be pushed to GiHub when major changes occur as that will be my Version Control System throughout the entire project.
